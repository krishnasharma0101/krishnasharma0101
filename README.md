Hi, I'm @krishnasharma0101 aka Krishna Sharma 🌟
🔥 I'm fascinated by the power of Deep Learning and constantly exploring its applications.
💡 Currently, I'm leveling up my Python skills to become an advance developer, and I'm excited to dive deeper into AI/ML topics.
💬 If you're working on a project that combines Python with front-end or back-end development, I'd love to collaborate! 🤝 Let's brainstorm and learn together.
📲 Want to get in touch? Send me a message or ping me at [krishna.gwl11@gmail.com].
🌈 Pronouns:  he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a developer, problem-solver, and coffee connoisseur. When I'm not crafting elegant code or exploring new technologies, you can find me lacing up my hiking boots and hitting the trails to explore new places and connect with nature. Let's connect and see what adventures we can have in the world of software development!
